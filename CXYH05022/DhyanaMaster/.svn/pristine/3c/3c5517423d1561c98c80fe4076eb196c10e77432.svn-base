/**
  Tests to see if this driver supports a given controller. If a child device is provided, 
  it further tests to see if this driver supports creating a handle for the specified child device.

  This function checks to see if the driver specified by This supports the device specified by 
  ControllerHandle. Drivers will typically use the device path attached to 
  ControllerHandle and/or the services from the bus I/O abstraction attached to 
  ControllerHandle to determine if the driver supports ControllerHandle. This function 
  may be called many times during platform initialization. In order to reduce boot times, the tests 
  performed by this function must be very small, and take as little time as possible to execute. This 
  function must not change the state of any hardware devices, and this function must be aware that the 
  device specified by ControllerHandle may already be managed by the same driver or a 
  different driver. This function must match its calls to AllocatePages() with FreePages(), 
  AllocatePool() with FreePool(), and OpenProtocol() with CloseProtocol().  
  Because ControllerHandle may have been previously started by the same driver, if a protocol is 
  already in the opened state, then it must not be closed with CloseProtocol(). This is required 
  to guarantee the state of ControllerHandle is not modified by this function.

  @param[in]  This                 A pointer to the EFI_DRIVER_BINDING_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in]  ControllerHandle     The handle of the controller to test. This handle 
                                   must support a protocol interface that supplies 
                                   an I/O abstraction to the driver.
  @param[in]  RemainingDevicePath  A pointer to the remaining portion of a device path.  This 
                                   parameter is ignored by device drivers, and is optional for bus 
                                   drivers. For bus drivers, if this parameter is not NULL, then 
                                   the bus driver must determine if the bus controller specified 
                                   by ControllerHandle and the child controller specified 
                                   by RemainingDevicePath are both supported by this 
                                   bus driver.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS              The device specified by ControllerHandle and
                                   RemainingDevicePath is supported by the driver specified by This.
  @retval EFI_ALREADY_STARTED      The device specified by ControllerHandle and
                                   RemainingDevicePath is already being managed by the driver
                                   specified by This.
  @retval EFI_ACCESS_DENIED        The device specified by ControllerHandle and
                                   RemainingDevicePath is already being managed by a different
                                   driver or an application that requires exclusive access.
                                   Currently not implemented.
  @retval EFI_UNSUPPORTED          The device specified by ControllerHandle and
                                   RemainingDevicePath is not supported by the driver specified by This.
