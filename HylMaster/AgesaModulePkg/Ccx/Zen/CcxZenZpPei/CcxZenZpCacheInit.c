/**

 *
 * Program MTRRs to describe given range as given cache type.  Use MTRR pairs
 * starting with the given MTRRphys Base address, and use as many as is
 * required up to (excluding) MSR 020C, which is reserved for OS.
 *
 * "Limit" in the context of this procedure is not the numerically correct
 * limit, but rather the Last address+1, for purposes of coding efficiency
 * and readability.  Size of a region is then Limit-Base.
 *
 * 1. Size of each range must be a power of two
 * 2. Each range must be naturally aligned (Base is same as size)
 *
 * There are two code paths: the ascending path and descending path (analogous
 * to bsf and bsr), where the next limit is a function of the next set bit in
 * a forward or backward sequence of bits (as a function of the Limit).  We
 * start with the ascending path, to ensure that regions are naturally aligned,
 * then we switch to the descending path to maximize MTRR usage efficiency.
 * Base=0 is a special case where we start with the descending path.
 * Correct Mask for region is 2comp(Size-1)-1,
 * which is 2comp(Limit-Base-1)-1 *
 * @param[in]     Base - Base address[47:16] of specified range.
 * @param[in]     *LimitPtr - Limit address[47:16] of specified range.
 * @param[in]     MtrrAddr - address of var MTRR pair to start using.
 * @param[in]     MtrrType - Cache type for the range.
 * @param[in]  StdHeader         Config handle for library and services
