2. Known Issues/Limitations:
  - HYGON Binaries are intended for use as a matched set. Mixing binaries from 
    different releases is not recommended and may not boot or may not function 
	properly.  Specifically, the SMU FW images, the PSP Firmware, the ABL images, 
	the secure debug unlock binary, and the security binary must be matched. 
	These binaries address the assessed vulnerability groups outlined please contact
	with Hygon Technical Team.
  - Unused lanes should be declared as PCIe engines in the platform BIOS topology
    table.  Please reference the BIOS SDK Interface SPEC.
    section 3.6.2 DXIO Driver Common Structure for more information.
  - To install or boot Windows Server 2016, OS Build 14393.1378 or later should
    be used.
    https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4022723/windows-10-update-kb4022723
    For older builds of Windows Server 2016, IOMMU should be disabled.
  - See the Processor Programming Reference, section 7.4.3. It describes the
    processor routing PCI I/O access using the PCI I/O address map registers
    (X86IOBaseAddress and X86IOLimitAddress). Failure to program these will cause
    problems with accesses that cross a 4-byte boundary. Specifically, the access
    will "complete," but only the first portion of the access will be done. These
    registers need to be programmed by platform BIOS. The data fabric architecture
    requires every PCI I/O port to be mapped in the registers and does not support
    subtractive address space.
